# Welcome to the Froggie-To-Do Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our open-source project! Your contributions are highly valued and can make a real impact. Follow the steps below to get started:

 1. **Find an Issue**: Look through the [Issues](https://github.com/xiacodes/Froggie-To-Do/issues) for issues labelled as 'help wanted' or 'good first issue'. These issues are specifically curated for contributors who are new to the project.

2. **Comment on the Issue**: Once you've found an issue you'd like to work on, comment on the issue to express your interest! Let me know how you'd like to contribute and ask any clarifying questions if needed!

3. **Confirmation**: After you've commented on the issue, we'll respond to confirm your contribution plan. Once we've agreed on the contribution, we'll create a dedicated branch for you to work on.

4. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project that you can freely work on!

5. **Work on the Issue**: On your forked repository, find the branch created for the issue. Make your changes, write code, and implement the solution as discussed!

6. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes to the issue-specific branch. Be sure to write meaningful commit messages that describe the changes you've made!

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Once you're satisfied with your changes, create a pull request from your forked repository to the main issue branch from this repository. Mention the issue number in the pull request description to link it with the issue you're addressing!

8. **Review and Feedback**: I will review your pull request, provide feedback, and suggest any necessary changes. Be prepared to engage in discussions to refine your contribution!

9. **Finalize and Merge**: Once all feedback is addressed and the changes are approved, I'll merge your pull request into the main project repository!

Congratulations, you've contributed to our open-source project! Your code is now part of our project, and you've made a meaningful contribution to our community!

If you have any questions or need assistance at any point, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help and guide you throughout the contribution process~! üòéüëç
